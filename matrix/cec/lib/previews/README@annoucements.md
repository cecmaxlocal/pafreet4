# RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT

With release upon us, I can assure you there will be bugs, broken aspects of the game, etc. We highly encourage you to report any bugs in <#1363919868826750986> as they will all be reviewed all throughout the coming days.

With that being said, I can't thank you enough for how long you've waited for a game that's been well over three months in development, through delays, setbacks, and countless hours of hard work on setting up everything. Your patience and tremendous support mean the world to us and now we're finally ready to deliver a high quality Starkiller base (probably the first one ðŸ’€ ), the **wait is ALMOST over!**

To notify those who plan to come to launch ahead of time, please head outside of the base below the podium and STS with your division. <@&1349471985075228676> and <@&1349471985075228677> will be actively guarding the podium. I won't expect perfection since nobody has viewed the map yet. 

For any **Resistance Personnel**, you will not be brought the the podium, **PLAY AS TROOPER UNTIL THE LAUNCH IS OVER AND EVERYONE IS SET FREE**
