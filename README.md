Of course. A project with such a diverse and interesting technology stack deserves a comprehensive `README.md`. This file explains the project's vision, architecture, and how each technology fits into the larger picture, all wrapped in the "Giant Otter" theme.

Here is a `README.md` for your project, `./pafreet4`.

# `./pafreet4`: The Giant Otter Policy Framework

**P**teronura **A**pplication **FREET**oolkit **4** (`pafreet4`) is a multi-language, multi-platform ecosystem for defining, parsing, and enforcing complex data form policies. It is conceptually modeled after the sophisticated communication and social structures of Giant Otters (*Pteronura brasiliensis*), the "river wolves" of South America.

The core of the project is a custom-built Domain-Specific Language (DSL) called **OtterScript**, designed to declare data validation rules in a readable, maintainable way.

## The "Giant Otter" Metaphor

To understand the project's architecture, it helps to understand the metaphor:

*   **The River**: Represents your data streams, APIs, and databases. It's a living environment where data flows.
*   **The Otters**: These are the autonomous policy agents. Each "otter" is a compiled set of rules from an OtterScript file. They watch over a specific part of the "river."
*   **The Otter Language (OtterScript)**: The formal grammar that defines policies. Otters "speak" this language to understand their duties (e.g., "a user must have a name," "an order total must be positive").
*   **The Clan**: A group of related policies (otters) that work together to protect a territory (an application or service).

## Architectural Overview

`pafreet4` is not a single application but a collection of interoperating components, each built with the best tool for the job. This explains the diverse technology stack.

## Technology Stack & Components

| Component | Technology | Language(s) | Role & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Policy Engine** (`./core-engine`) | **Compiler Tools** | **C++, Yacc/Bison** | The heart of `pafreet4`. Yacc defines the formal grammar for OtterScript. The C++ code provides the semantic actions and compiles policies into a fast, native, shareable library (`.so`, `.dll`). This provides maximum performance and portability for the core logic. |
| **API Servers** (`./server`) | **Backend Services** | **Dlang** | High-performance, memory-safe REST API servers that load the C++ policy engine as a native library. Dlang was chosen for its C++ interoperability, speed, and modern concurrency features, making it ideal for handling high-traffic policy validation requests. |
| **Desktop/Web App** (`./client`) | **Client GUI** | **Dart (Flutter)** | A modern, cross-platform client application for policy authors. Users can write, test, and manage OtterScript policies through a user-friendly interface. Flutter allows a single Dart codebase to target Windows, macOS, Linux, and the Web, ensuring a consistent user experience. |
| **CLI Tool** (`./tools/cli`) | **Client CLI** | **FreeBASIC** | A lightweight, dependency-free command-line tool for batch validation. This legacy component is maintained for its speed and simplicity, perfect for DevOps pipelines or for processing large data files against a set of policies without the overhead of the full client or server. |

## Project Status

This project is currently in the **Alpha** stage. The core policy engine is stable, but the server and client APIs are subject to change. It serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for multi-language system design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the toolchain for each component you wish to build:
- **Core Engine**: `g++` (or `clang++`), `cmake`, `flex`, `bison`
- **Servers**: A D compiler (`dmd`, `ldc2`) and the `dub` package manager.
- **App/Client**: The [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **CLI Tool**: The [FreeBASIC compiler](https://www.freebasic.net/) (`fbc`).

### Building

Each component resides in its own directory and contains its own build instructions.

1.  **Build the Core Policy Engine:**
    ```bash
    cd ./core-engine
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2.  **Build and Run the Dlang Server:**
    ```bash
    cd ./server
    dub run
    ```

3.  **Run the Flutter Client:**
    ```bash
    cd ./client
    flutter pub get
    flutter run
    ```

4.  **Build the FreeBASIC Tool:**
    ```bash
    cd ./tools/cli
    fbc main.bas -o otter-cli
    ```

## Example: OtterScript Policy

Here is a small sample of what an OtterScript policy file (`.otter`) looks like. This "form policy" defines rules for a user registration event.

```yacc
// Policy for ensuring the integrity of a new clan member.
POLICY "NewUserRegistration" ON STREAM "users.create"

// A giant otter must have a name.
FORM "profile" REQUIRES "name" IS NOT EMPTY;

// Age must be a positive integer.
FORM "profile" REQUIRES "age" > 0;

// All otters belong to a clan. Provide a default if missing.
FORM "profile" DEFAULT "clan_name" TO "River Guardians" IF EMPTY;

// Send a high-priority alert if the 'email' field is malformed.
ALERT "Invalid Email Format" IF "email" NOT MATCHES /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
```
